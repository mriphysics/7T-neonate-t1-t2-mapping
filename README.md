Colour maps were generated using ['colorcet'](https://colorcet.com/download/index.html): a set of perceptually uniform colour maps. The function has been bundled in with this repo, but please be aware of the license terms for colorcet, which are included in the header of function `lib/colorcet.m`. The maps are based on the work of Peter Kovesi, please see this [arXiv pre-print](https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.03700) for more.
